**Context**

Hello! This is an archived project from my econometrics final during my bachelor's education @ CSUSB. This project acts as a template for anybody looking to understand the project workflow of an econ major. Given any different inputs for the same variables, this same conceptual model can be applied to many real world fields such as risk analysis, audits, accounting, etc.

**Abstract**

Using time-series data from FRED, Okun's Law is tested on a national scale, reaching back from quarterly reports starting Jan 1948. In attempt of identifying a relationship between Unemployment Rate (UNRATE) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), we fail to reject the null hypothesis due to mixed results between the lagged and current variables representing Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For future research, this could mean restructuring analysis to support further lagged variables, reaching back up to a year rather than a quarter.
